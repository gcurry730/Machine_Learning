# Introduction to Machine Learning
Repository for Machine Learning course at Northwestern University

##Includes:  
### **HW1**: Python Warm-up
A warm up in Python which implements a breadth-first search algorithm on a non-binary decision tree.  
### **HW2**: ID3 Decision Tree   
A decision tree learning algorithm ([ID3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm)) with pruning implemented applied to a synthetic dataset. Uses labeled training data, to generate a model. Then uses labeled validation data, to report the model's accuracy. Unlabeled test data is used to generate predictions.

* Main ID3 module: [ID3.py](https://github.com/gcurry730/EECS-349/blob/master/HW2/PS2.code/modules/ID3.py)
* Module used for pruning: [pruning.py](https://github.com/gcurry730/EECS-349/blob/master/HW2/PS2.code/modules/pruning.py)
* Main class used: [Node](https://github.com/gcurry730/EECS-349/blob/master/HW2/PS2.code/modules/node.py)
